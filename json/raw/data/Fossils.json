Consequently, their bodies are never preserved as fossils, and questions about their jaws remain unanswered. The size and placement in the stone of the shark's teeth are actually the only things we have to work with.

This fearsome chap is practically synonymous with the word \"dinosaur,\" and for good reason! At up to 42 feet long with banana-sized teeth, it was one of the largest carnivores ever to walk the earth. It's unclear how fast T. Rex was since estimates vary wildly... I am just relieved I will never have to escape one. Hoo.",

They were also one of the most successful classes of animal ever, existing for over 300 million years. Some 50,000 species have been identified in sizes ranging from three millimeters to over two feet! Alas, that is the very limit of my enthusiasm for them, though— they look rather too much like bugs.",
