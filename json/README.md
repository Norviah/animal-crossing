### Structure

  - [raw](./raw) contains the JSON files that were downloaded straight from the various spreadsheets, I consider the files raw as they have not been touched,
  - [data](./data) contains the JSON files after they have been sanitized and modified so working with them can be more friendly and easier, and
  - [combined](./combined) contains the sanitized JSON files combined via categories, which is determined by [this](../src/util/categories.ts) file.

### Credit

If you use any JSON file for a project, please credit and link these spreadsheets somewhere in your project:
  - the [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mo7myqHry5r_TKvakvIhHbcEAEQpSiNoNQoIS8sMpvM/edit#gid=1397507627) spreadsheet,
  - the [Translations](https://tinyurl.com/acnh-translation) spreadsheet, and
  - the [Seasons](https://tinyurl.com/acnh-calendar) spreadsheet.
