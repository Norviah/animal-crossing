      "The Dungeness crab wears a pretty fan-shaped shell that's often done up in purple hues. But eye-catching colors aside, this fellow can be surprisingly hard to spot! That's because the Dungeness crab is something of an expert hider. When scared, it plays a nifty trick! That is, it buries itself beneath the sand with impressive speed. \"Now you see me, now you don't,\" it says as it vanishes before your very eyes!"

But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?"

They use these suction-cupped feet not just to move about...but to...eh... grab hold of dinner guests as well. Finally, it should be noted that when a sea star loses an arm, it can grow it back. More impressive yes, a served sea star arm...can sometimes grow an entire sea star body back!"

These silly things are known for popping their heads out of the sand to nibble on plankton drifting by.

But I think they look more like prairie dogs peeking out of desert hidey-holes. \"Prairie eels\" has a lovely ring, don't you think?"
