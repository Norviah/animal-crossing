      "The Dungeness crab wears a pretty fan-shaped shell that's often done up in purple hues. But eye-catching colors aside, this fellow can be surprisingly hard to spot! That's because the Dungeness crab is something of an expert hider. When scared, it plays a nifty trick! That is, it buries itself beneath the sand with impressive speed. \"Now you see me, now you don't,\" it says as it vanishes before your very eyes!"

But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?"

Well, I suppose its tentacles do give a sting when touched...but it's only a mild thing to the likes of us. Other creatures may not be so fond of this translucent beauty. Though who can blame them, really? Moon jellyfish have stinging cells called cnidocytes that kill fish and other small critters that float by. And they use their \"oral arms\" to pull these morsels into their mouths and stomachs. Indeed, one need but observe the moon jellyfish to see how brutal AND beautiful nature can be."

They use these suction-cupped feet not just to move about...but to...eh... grab hold of dinner guests as well. Finally, it should be noted that when a sea star loses an arm, it can grow it back. More impressive yes, a served sea star arm...can sometimes grow an entire sea star body back!"

      "Whelks are sea snails that migrate from deep water to shallow water when the weather changes. Avid carnivores, they feed on worms, crustaceans, and mollusks. In fact, these wily snails have been known to use their own shells to pry open the shells of their victims! They then use a rough tongue-like organ with thousands of tiny teeth to lick their victims' shells clean. Eh... you might want to put that image out of your mind when it's your turn to dine."
