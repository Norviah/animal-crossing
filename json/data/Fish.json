Or, rather, the lack of them! And just what is a barbel, you ask? Well, a barbel looks a little something like a mustache. A run-of-the-mill carp will sport this unsightly \"facial hair,\" while a crucian carp is considerably better groomed! I tried to grow a mustache when I was younger. It never did fill in quite right... All for the best in the end, as mustaches go so much better with noses than with beaks!"

These flat fish spend much of their lives buried under the sandy ocean floor, waiting for prey to happen by. Imagine the surprise for said prey when they strike. It would be as if your kitchen floor were to bite you."

Thus these fish are often found using their prehensile tails to hold tight in amongst the sea grass. And here's one final fact for you... Sea horses have no stomach and so must constantly feed to stay alive! Indeed, the life of a land horse sounds far easier than that of the hardworking horse of the sea."
