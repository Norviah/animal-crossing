I feel for the poor thing...but it is still foul!"

But truth be told, baby barnacles are avid travelers, drifting shell-less about the sea before settling down. Once they find a good rock to affix themselves to, they float free no more. Which begs the question... Do adult acorn barnacles ever look out across the open sea...and long for youthful adventure once more?"

Though eating parasites does not sound like a happy childhood... Is that why the fish is so bitter?"

It means you don't have to lay eyes upon their prickly legs or overly long antennae like us night owls! Of course, crickets are best known for the chirping sound they make by rubbing their wings together. Some find the noise lovely to listen to. Alas, it only serves to remind me of another unpleasant fact... Which is to say...you will find a cricket's ears right next to its knees! I've gone weak in the knees at the mention of it!"

A run-of-the-mill carp will sport this unsightly \"facial hair,\" while a crucian carp is considerably better groomed! I tried to grow a mustache when I was younger. It never did fill in quite right... All for the best in the end, as mustaches go so much better with noses than with beaks!"

And yes, these mighty creatures look as though they could eat a swimmer whole. But they eat plankton instead and get valuable nutrients from an algae they live in symbiosis with. Indeed, these enormous gents get all the sustenance they need by lying face up with their shells half-open. If such was my life, I'd be happy as a clam too."

Hive bees then chew the substance and spit it into the honeycomb, fluttering their wings to dry it out. Yes, you could say honey is a tasty tribute to the hard work of the humble honeybee. Oh! Oh my! You mustn't confuse my lengthy description for admiration! At the end of the day, honeybees are still insects, and thus still ghastly! A wee bit less ghastly than most, I admit."

Meanwhile, small fish and crabs hide from predators and even raise their young among the snuggling oysters. With all the hubbub, an oyster bed sounds like the last place one would get some sleep!"

The sticky, stringy stuff ensnares predators, allowing the cuke to make its escape and grow its insides back. One might say…the sea cucumber is a GUTSY creature, indeed. Hoo hoo, hee hee!

The sea horse, you see, has but a wee fin on its back, which propels it through water rather poorly. Thus these fish are often found using their prehensile tails to hold tight in amongst the sea grass. And here's one final fact for you... Sea horses have no stomach and so must constantly feed to stay alive! Indeed, the life of a land horse sounds far easier than that of the hardworking horse of the sea."

Perhaps its more demure relatives—the sea cucumber and the sea star—disapprove of its outlandish look? It would certainly explain why sea stars gobble up sea urchins every chance they get! But worry not for our spiky friend. Its venomous spines are an effective deterrent to many a predator."

In fact, some will eat creatures several times larger than themselves. To catch their prey, many of these ruthless predators spin sticky webs of surprising strength. Worse yet, they've also been known to ambush their victims, and some even chase down their meals! All this talk about the feeding habits of spiders... I'm feeling quite queasy. Hoot! The horror!"

Though they can grow up to 12 feet from claw to claw and weigh up to 40 pounds, they're said to be docile. In fact, these gentle giants love to hide, attaching seaweed and sponges to their shell as camouflage. My feathers, if only I could unsee the SPIDER in the spider crab... I'm sure I'd find it charming as can be."

By all accounts, the vampire squid is a a gentle sort who squirts bioluminecesant goo at foes. Sp, how did it get the eerie official name \"Vampyroteuthis inernalis\"? That means \"vampire squid from the heck,\" you see. The problem is that the squid's \"cloak.\" Its arms are webbed with velvet-red skin and lined with toothy spikes.

Unlike many of their kin in the shark family, whale sharks are nonviolent, eating only plankton and such. They grow slowly and live long, relaxed lives of filter feeding and leisure in warm waters. So if you ever have to choose a fish as a roommate, you could do worse than the whale shark. Unless you can't swim."
